Today I added the ability to comment on this site. It was implemented with [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com), a free and privacy-focused commenting system. (**This is not an advertising!**)

You can try it out right now: the comment section is below.

## Why Hyvor Talk, and not Disqus or Commento

I did not choose Disqus, because I didn't liked it's design and because it tracks you and it's free plan has ads.

And not Commento, because it's paid. If Commento was always free (without the 30-day trial) then I would picked Commento.

## Installing

No, this is not a tutorial.

Installing Hyvor Talk was very easy: just added a few lines into the `post` layout and customized the theme.

## Syntax

Hyvor Talk uses Markdown (or something that is **very** similar to Markdown)

Here's a cheatsheet:

| Description     | What you type                    | What you get                            |
|:----------------|:---------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Links           | `[Example](http://example.com)`  | [Example](http://example.com)           |
| Emojis          | `:grinning:`                  | :grinning:                          |
| Pictures        | `![Picture](picsum.photos/500/)` | ![Picture](http://picsum.photos/500/)   |
| Bold            | `*Bold*`                         | **Bold**                                |
| Italic          | `_Italic_`                       | *Italic*                                |
| Underlined      | `__Underlined__`                 | ❓ No Underlined in Markdown?           |
| Quote           | `> Quote`                        | :sob: No quotes inside tables        |
| Code with syntax highlighting | `It works just like in Markdown` | It works just like in Markdown |
| Ordered lists   | `1. This is a list`              | 1. This is a list                       |
| Unordered lists | `* This is a list`               | :sob: No lists inside tables         |
